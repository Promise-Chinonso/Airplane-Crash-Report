# Airplane-Crash-Report
----
# Project Objective:
----
To determine the key affected areas in the plane crash dataset spanning between the year 1908 to 2009 across several fields
----
# Data Source:
----
I obtained the dataset used for this analysis from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908
----
# Data Transformation:
----
The data transforming process was made easy with the help of Powerbi query editor. I validated the data formats of each field in the dataset, checked the column profiles and distributions for more insight into the loaded dataset. Other necessary changes were made before loading onto the desktop for analysis
----
# Data Visualization:
----
I made use of the right charts for the different data categories; for the time-related data, i used an area graph, whereas bar graphs helped me to view the top entries in represented fields

# Data Insight:
----
There is a positive correlation between the number of passengers aboard and number of fatalities recorded, meaning, the more the passenger, the more the fatalities
----
There is an increased rate of plane crashes towards the end of the year which can be likened to the increased number of travels taking place as a result of the festive celebrations and holidays
----
Russia, Brazil and Colombia has the higest number of fatalities from airplane crashes
----
# Recommendation:
----
Airline companies should put factors like weather condition, condition of the airplane, and others into consideration to ensure the safety of human lives during air travels
